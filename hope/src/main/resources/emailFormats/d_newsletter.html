    Just wanted to inform you of the two new tools we just launched for ML annotation:
    <br />
    <br />

    1) Image polygon and rectangle bounding boxes. Just upload images and start tagging.
    <br />
    2) Full-length document annotations. You can upload PDF, Doc, Docx etc and do entity, phrase, paragraph, etc annotations.

</p>


<p>
    <br />
    I am super excited to hear your feedback and do everything possible to help you in building your ML datasets.

    P.S: Here are the quick video demos: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNCy4JmlG4k">Image bounding box</a> & <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU3nwu4SwX4">Document annotation.</a>
